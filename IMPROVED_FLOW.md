# Global Pay - Improved User Flow

## 🎯 Generalized Signup Flow

### **Clean & Simple User Experience**

#### **1. Wallet Connection Check**
When a user connects their wallet, the system automatically:
- ✅ Checks if the user exists in the database
- ✅ If user exists → Redirect to appropriate dashboard
- ✅ If new user → Show signup flow

#### **2. Simple Signup Questions**
**Question 1: "Are you an organization owner?"**
- **YES** → Go to organization setup
- **NO** → Complete as employee/freelancer

**Question 2 (Only for Organization Owners):**
- **"What's your organization name?"**
- Auto-creates organization after input

#### **3. Automatic Profile Creation**
- **ENS Integration**: Automatically detects and uses ENS name if available
- **Clean Database**: Creates user record with proper type
- **Smart Redirects**: Takes user to the right dashboard immediately

## 🔐 Route Protection & Separation

### **Employer-Only Routes**
- `/dashboard` → Organization management
- `/dashboard/organization` → Employee management
- **Protected by RouteGuard**: Only `EMPLOYER` users can access
- **Auto-redirect**: Employees trying to access get redirected to `/streams`

### **Employee-Only Routes**
- `/streams` → Payment streams view
- **Protected by RouteGuard**: Only `EMPLOYEE` users can access  
- **Auto-redirect**: Employers trying to access get redirected to `/dashboard`

### **Smart Dashboard Routing**
- `/dashboard` → Checks user type and redirects appropriately:
  - **Employers** → `/dashboard/organization`
  - **Employees** → `/streams`

## 🏗 Technical Implementation

### **New Components**
- **`SignupFlow`** - Clean 2-step signup process

- **`AuthWrapper`** - Handles user detection and signup

### **New API Routes**

- **`POST /api/user/create`** - Create new user with organization (if employer)

### **Route Protection**
```typescript
// Employer-only routes
<RouteGuard allowedUserTypes={['EMPLOYER']} redirectTo="/streams">
  <DashboardContent />
</RouteGuard>

// Employee-only routes  
<RouteGuard allowedUserTypes={['EMPLOYEE']} redirectTo="/dashboard">
  <StreamsContent />
</RouteGuard>
```
